# TunedLlavaDelights : Llava Fine-Tune on Indian Desserts with Nutritional Info 

## Overview
This project is an exploration into the capabilities of fine-tuning the Llava model specifically for Indian desserts. 
We've successfully fine-tuned the model to identify and provide in-depth nutritional information on 5 distinct Indian dessert items. 
This not only includes a brief overview of each dessert, covering aspects like taste and nutritional content, but also allergen notes, recommended times to eat, and feel after consumption.

## 🎥 Demo Video

Watch our model in action and see how it beautifully integrates AI with culinary tradition:

🌟 **Key Highlights**:
- **Enhanced Detection**: Our model can recognize some dessert items that were previously undetectable by standard Llava and even GPT-4 models.
- **Image Recognition**: It showcases improved accuracy in image detection, surpassing GPT-4v in recognizing specific images and providing detailed information.
- **Replicate Training**: Utilized Replicate for training and hosting, ensuring a seamless integration and user experience.

## Purpose 💡
This project serves as a dynamic showcase of how fine-tuning LVM (Language Vision Models) on domain-specific datasets can significantly enhance AI's understanding and analysis capabilities. 

### Applications 🚀
- **PCB Verification**: Training LVMs on images of PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) to verify and filter them based on specific queries.
- **Domain-Specific Training**: Tailoring the model to recognize and evaluate domain-specific or private image datasets for more effective and accurate recognition.
